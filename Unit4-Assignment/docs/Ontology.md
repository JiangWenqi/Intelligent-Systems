# Ontology

# What is OWL?
- OWL is the Web Ontology Language
- It’s part of the `W3C` Semantic Web framework
- It’s a `W3C` standard

# Components of OWL Ontologies
An OWL ontology consists of `Individuals`, `Properties`, and `Classes`, which roughly correspond to Protege frames `Instances`, `Slots` and `Classes`.


# OWL and XML
- XML is a syntax
  - EXtensible Markup Language
- XML describes a tree structure
- XML was designed to improve interoperability by standardising syntax

# OWL and RDF
- Another Semantic Web language
  - Resource Description Framework
- RDF describes a graph of nodes and arcs, each normally identified by a URI
- RDF statements are triples
  - subject → predicate → object
  - myhouse - islocatedIn - Manchester
- Semantics are limited and use is unconstrained compared to OWL
- RDF Schema
- Adds the notion of classes to RDF
- Allows hierarchies of classes and properties
- Allows simple constraints on properties
- OWL has the same interpretation of some RDFS statements (subsumption, domain and range)
