## Install by hand
In addition to this automatic registry-based plugin installation, plugins may also be installed by hand. In the most common case, Prot´eg´e plugins are packaged as Java `.jar` files. These can be installed by moving them into the plugins folder in your Prot´eg´e installation.

Copy `.jar`s under `Unit4-Assignment/resources` to `/Applications/Protégé.app/Contents/Java/plugins`

Note that independently of the installation mechanism plugins will be ready to use only after a restart (remember to save your work before re-starting Prot´eg´e).
